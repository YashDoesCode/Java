## Repository Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my Java programming journey, featuring various projects, coding exercises, and implementations that I've developed and continuously pushed to GitHub. The codebase chronicles my evolution from a beginner in 2021 (9th grade) to present, demonstrating progressive skill development and understanding of Java concepts.

This repository receives frequent updates with new implementations, optimized solutions, and experimental projects. Students following ICSE/ISC curriculum will find this repository particularly valuable for mastering core Java fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and practical application development.

## ðŸŽ“ My Learning Journey

### Class VIII (2020)
I began my coding journey with Java as my first coding language from **Code with Harry**, whose tutorials laid my basic foundation in Java programming.

### Class IX (2021)
The first 6 months of class IX, I understood Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts in Java:
- Linked Lists
- ArrayLists
- BufferedReaders
- HashMaps
- Binary Trees



These channels provided in-depth explanations, practical implementations, and comprehensive coverage of advanced Java topics.

### Academic References
My theoretical understanding was strengthened through comprehensive study of:

1. **"Java: The Complete Reference" (11th Edition)**
   - Author: Herbert Schildt
   - Comprehensive coverage of Java features and APIs
   - Deep dive into advanced concepts and best practices

2. **Sumita Arora's Java Programming**
   - ISC Class 11th and 12th curriculum
   - Structured approach aligned with academic requirements
   - Excellent for examination preparation and concept clarity
